1. How to run the program.

    ## mvn clean
    ## mvn install
    ## mvn package
    ## jar -jar target/inchi-0.1.ja r

2. Time complexity of the solution.

    Let N is the number of inchi lines.
    Let M is the number of dictory lines.
    The time complexity is O(s*N*M)
    The s is the time of pattern detection algorithm which is Boyerâ€“Moore string search algorithm.


3. How to run the test and how to interpret the results.
